# Solutions for the 2025 Labs

This repository has the solutions for the 2025 Labs.

**IMPORTANT:** If you are using Visual Studio Code or RustRover, please open the lab folder in the IDE, not the repository root. (i.e `code ./lab02`)

As there are multiple exercises, we chose to split them into multiple binaries. To flash and run them, run `cargo run --bin <name_of_binary>` (without the `.rs` extension).

```shell
lab-2025-solutions
├── lab02 -> GPIO
├── lab03 -> PWM & ADC
└── lab04 -> Asynchronous Development
```
